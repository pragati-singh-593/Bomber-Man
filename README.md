# Bomber-Man Game

A simple Bomber-Man Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Introduction

There is a 9*9 grid which makes  a total of 81 boxes. Out of these 81  boxes, 10 boxes contain bombs  and other boxes are normal. If a  normal box is clicked, the user is  awarded a point and if a user  clicks on a box containing a  bomb, the game gets over (GAME  OVER message is displayed). After the game gets over, the user is given an option to start a fresh Game.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Randomly select a box
- Option to start a fresh game once it is over.


## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start playing the game.
